# Memorize-This

this game is stll unfinished. It is good up to level 5.

all that is done is:

created the levels, players, retry level, advancing to the next level
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The game needs a lot more variety still but the mechanics are there for the most part.

                                                        Ideas: 
  have not created the different difficulties yet(easy medium hard)
  timer for harder difficulty
  moving objects that will be recalled based on id, not by coordinates (objects can move and flash, still and flash, move and no flash)

                                                problems encountered:
  trying to create the images from the sprite sheets. the game says there are errors with the drawImage within each game objects. NPE is   encountered
